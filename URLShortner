URLShorter:
=========

Assumption for the Data Envelop calculations:
=======================
100 million URLs generated/day
Average URL length: 100bytes
  Storage:
    365Billion * 100 == 36.5 TB
QPS:  100million/24/365 = 1160
Read Operation: 1:10 write/read ratio so RPS: 1160

Two Endpoints:
    URL SHortening:
   POST: api/v1/data/shorten
   Request Param: {longURK : longURLSTring}
   return shortURL
     URL ReDirecting:
   GET: api/v1/shortURL
   returns Long URL for HTTP Redirection
   
   Call to TinyURL has two responses:
      301: Permanent Redirection (Mostly this)
	     Requests are directed to the Shortening Server directly and NOT through shortening service
	  302: Temporary Redirect
	     Requests are directed to shgorting first; helpful in case we need to track the click rate and number of requests
		 
 URL Redirection: using HashValue
<ShortURL,LongURL> 
1. LongURL is Hit
2. if no entry in DB for URL; cretae a UniqueID using UniqueIdGenerator:
3. use base62/SHA to create shortURL to append to base Url
